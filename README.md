### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hu, Zhijing

I am an incoming master's student in computer science at Columbia University. Previously,
I graduated from Zhejiang University in the College of Electrical Engineering with a bachelor's
degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation.

**I am actively looking for 2024 summer interns in the US and China.**

### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...

General computer science, including:

1. Systems and networks
2. Database systems
3. Software engineering
4. Programming languages and compilers
5. Web development
6. Cryptograph
7. Theory, algorithms, and AI

Besides, I'm curious about Fintech, such as quant trading.
