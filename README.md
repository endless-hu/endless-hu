### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hu Zhijing

I am a master's student in computer science at Columbia University, graduating in Decemeber 2024. Previously,
I graduated from Zhejiang University in the College of Electrical Engineering with a bachelor's
degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation.

I am interning at Alibaba Group this summer as a Java SDE in the User Growth team at Miravia, a Spanish 
e-commerce platform.

**I am actively seeking a full-time SDE position starting December 2024 in the US and China.**

### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...

General computer science, including:

1. Systems and networks
2. Database systems
3. Graphics
4. Software engineering
5. Programming languages and compilers
6. Web development
7. Cryptograph
8. Theory, algorithms, and AI

Besides, I'm curious about Fintech, such as quant trading.
