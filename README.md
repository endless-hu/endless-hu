### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hu Zhijing

I recently received a master's degree in computer science from Columbia University. Previously,
I graduated from Zhejiang University in the College of Electrical Engineering with a bachelor's
degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation.

I interned at Alibaba Group in Summer 2024 as a Java SDE in the User Growth team at Miravia, a Spanish 
e-commerce platform.

### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...

General computer science, including:

1. Systems and networks
